-- Logical database design (from text section 3.5)

-- Entity Sets to Tables (from text section 3.5.1)

-- Student --- Enrolled --- Class

-- An entity is mapped to a relation, 
-- each attribute of the entity set becomes an attribute of the the table,
-- keys are declared directly from the diagram.
